## Infrastructure

The AWS resources created by the script are detailed bellow:

- Networking
    - 1 VPC
    - 1 Internet Gateway
    - 1 NAT gateway (and 1 EIP)
    - 2 Routing tables (and needed routes)
    - 3 public subnets, 1 per AZ. If a region has less than 3 AZs it will create same number of public subnets as AZs.
    - 3 private subnets, 1 per AZ. If a region has less than 3 AZs it will create same number of public subnets as AZs.
- ECS
    - 1 ECS Cluster with AWS CloudWatch Container Insights enabled.
- IAM
    - 1 task-execution-iam-role  

## Prerequisites
There are general steps that you must follow in order to launch the infrastructure resources.

Before launching the solution please follow the next steps:

1) Install Terraform, use Terraform v1.0 or above. You can visit [this](https://releases.hashicorp.com/terraform/) Terraform official webpage to download it.
2) Configure the AWS credentials into your machine (~/.aws/credentials). You need to use the following format:
```shell
    [AWS_PROFILE_NAME]
    aws_access_key_id = Replace_with_the_correct_access_Key
    aws_secret_access_key = Replace_with_the_correct_secret_Key
```
3) Export your AWS credentials in order to use the rest of the commands:
```shell
export AWS_PROFILE=Replace_with_the_correct_profile_name
```
4) Install aws cli from https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html

5) Fork this repository and [create the GitHub token granting access](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token) to this new repository in your account. Store this secret in AWS secrets manager using the aws cli.
```shell
aws secretsmanager create-secret --name ecs-github-token --secret-string "<github-token-created-above>"
```
Note you should create the secret in an AWS region where you plan to deploy the various examples. You can also set the default region by exporting the environment variable `export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=<default-region>`.

## Usage

**1.** Clone that recently forked repository from your account (not the one from the aws-ia organization) and change the directory to the appropriate one as shown below:

```bash
cd examples/core-infra/
```

**2.** Run Terraform init to download the providers and install the modules

```shell
terraform init
```
**3.** Copy the `terraform.tfvars.example` to `terraform.tfvars` and change as needed
```shell
cp terraform.tfvars.example terraform.tfvars
```

**4.** Review the terraform plan output, take a look at the changes that terraform will execute, and then apply them:

```shell
terraform plan
terraform apply
```

## Outputs

After the execution of the Terraform code you will get an output with needed IDs and values needed as input for the nexts Terraform applies. You can use this infrastructure to run other example blueprints, all you need is the `cluster_name`.

## Cleanup

Run the following command if you want to delete all the resources created before:

```shell
terraform destroy
```
