The architecture involves high-performance Amazon S3 compatible object storage alongside an application layer that is cloud-native. The benefits can be significant: economically, due to reduced need for constant high-capacity infrastructure; operationally, by accelerating development cycles; and from a security and control perspective. This approach increases the velocity of development by eliminating the need to create an entire machine learning compute layer internally and instead using Amazon EC2 and Amazon EKS.
