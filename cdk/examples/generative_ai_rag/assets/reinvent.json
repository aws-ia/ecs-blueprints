Its data and analytics team faced significant challenges extracting insights from its massive healthcare databases and found that writing complex SQL queries was time-consuming and error-prone. To address this, Merck collaborated with the AWS Generative AI Innovation Center to implement a generative AI text-to-SQL solution using Anthropic's Claude models on Amazon Bedrock. This innovation enables analysts to generate SQL queries from natural language with over 95% accuracy. Data workflows are now significantly streamlined, allowing Merck's scientists to make faster, more confident decisions and easily scale to incorporate additional databases.",

How you'll scale, how you'll prevent noisy neighbor, how you'll isolate tenant data, how you'll support remote data, how you'll shard workloads—these are among the many factors you must consider. This session examines the different strategies and patterns that are applied when designing a scalable multi-tenant data architecture that can evolve as your business evolves.
